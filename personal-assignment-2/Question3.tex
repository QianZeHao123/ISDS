\subsection{Hypothesis Test for Seasonal Differences in Beaver Body Temperature}
% 
% 
% 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The null hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no difference in mean internal body temperature of beavers between November and December.
    \item The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): Beavers have a lower mean internal body temperature in December than in November. ($H_1$ is complementary to $H_0$).
\end{itemize}
% 
\paragraph{I apply a one-tailed t-test since we are specifically interested in whether the mean temperature in December is lower.}
\paragraph{Because we are interested in whether the body temperature in December is lower than in November, this is a directional testing question.}

\paragraph{\textbf{Output:}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The test statistic is \textbf{-15.235 }.
    \item A bound on the p-value for the test is \textbf{4.224052e-31}.
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest that beavers have a lower mean internal body temperature in December than in November.
