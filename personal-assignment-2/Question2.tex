\section{Question 2}
\subsection{Find the modal tooth length across the entire data set.}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=rstyle]
# clear the console area
cat("\014")

# clear the environment var area
rm(list = ls())

# Load the Tooth Growth data set
data(ToothGrowth)

# Find the modal tooth length
modal_tooth_lengt = as.numeric(names(sort(
    table(ToothGrowth$len), decreasing = TRUE)[1]))
\end{lstlisting}
% \paragraph{Output: modal_tooth_lengt}
\paragraph{Env Output: $modal\_tooth\_length=26.4$}
\subsection{Mean tooth length for guinea pigs who were given their vitamins via orange juice}
% 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=rstyle]
# Calculate the mean tooth length for guinea pigs 
# given vitamins via orange juice
mean_tooth_length_orange = mean(
    ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"])
# mean_tooth_length_orange    
\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{Env Output: $mean\_tooth\_length\_orange=20.66333$}

\subsection{Create a side-by-side box-and-whisker plot:}
% 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=rstyle]
# Create a side-by-side box-and-whisker plot
# for tooth length by supplement type
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth, 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"),
        xlab = "Supplement Type", ylab = "Tooth Length",
        main = "Tooth Length by Supplement Type")

\subsection{Comment on which vitamin delivery approach is more effective:}
\paragraph{\textbf{Analytics}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item OJ has a higher \textbf{Median Value} than VC.
    \item OJ data is basically normally distributed, while VC is skewed.
    \item The upper and lower \textbf{quartiles} of VC's span longer distances, so the data is more dispersed.
    \item \textbf{The length of the box:} I don't think there's much difference between the two, and the degree of centralization in the data set is basically the same.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\textbf{Conclusion} I think OJ supplement is more effective.}
