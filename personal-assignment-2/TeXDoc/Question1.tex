\paragraph{1. B}
\paragraph{\textbf{Analytics:}  The answer options "0," "1," "2," and "3 or more" represent an ordered range, but the gaps between them are not necessarily equal. In this case, the data is ordered, but cannot perform exact mathematical operations, and is therefore classified as ordinal data.}
\paragraph{2. A}
\paragraph{\textbf{Analytics:} Not interested in the proportion each continent of origin make up.}
% 
\paragraph{3. B}
\paragraph{\textbf{Analytics:} Let Event A = British population said they preferred dogs to cats, \\ Event B = British population
    listed jazz as one of their favourite musical genres. \\
    A and B are mutual independent $\Rightarrow$ $P(AB)=P(A)P(B)=46\%*12\%=5.52\%$ }
\paragraph{4. A}
\paragraph{{\textbf{Analytics:} $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(AB)=\frac{4}{7}+\frac{5}{7}-\frac{6}{7}=\frac{3}{7}$}}
\paragraph{5. D}
\paragraph{{\textbf{Analytics:}
            \begin{equation*}
                F(u) =
                \begin{cases}
                    \frac{u^2}{4} \bigg |_{low}^{high} & \text{if } 0 \leq u \leq 2 \\

                \end{cases}
            \end{equation*}
            \begin{equation*}
                P(u>0.30)=\frac{u^2}{4} \bigg |_{0.30}^{2}=1-\frac{0.09}{4}=0.9775
