% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 
% 
% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.
% 
% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The Entropy Weight Method is a powerful analytical technique used in football team evaluation. It goes beyond traditional methods by considering the inherent information entropy within various performance attributes.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Key Characteristics
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Entropy: Reflects the degree of uncertainty or randomness within a dataset.
            \item Weight Assignment: Assigns weights to attributes based on their information entropy.

          \end{itemize}
    \item Objective
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The method aims to provide a nuanced evaluation, giving higher importance to attributes that contribute more to understanding a team's performance.
          \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Key Steps in Entropy Method}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Attribute Selection}
    \item \textbf{Entropy Calculation:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Utilize mathematical formulas to calculate the entropy of each selected attribute.
            \item Entropy = $- \sum (p_i \cdot \log_2(p_i))$, where $p_i$ is the probability of each attribute value.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Weight Assignment:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Assign weights to attributes based on their calculated entropy.
            \item Attributes with higher entropy receive lower weights, and vice versa.
            \item The sum of weights equals 1 for normalization.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Outcome:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The result is a set of weights that reflect the relative importance of each attribute in evaluating a football team's performance.
          \end{itemize}

\subsection{Method 2: Linear Transformation and Gradient Ascend}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Linear Transformation and Gradient Ascend}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Linear transformation involves transforming input variables into a new space where they are more linear and easier to model
    \item Our model will be taking in 5-dimension vector and transforming it to a 1-dimension vector $$ F_v: \mathbb{R}^{5} \Rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$
    \item The vector v basically consists of the following variables:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The number of games won by a team in $n^{th}$ week, $v_1$
            \item The number of games lost by a team in $n^{th}$ week, $v_2$
            \item The number of games drawn by a team in $n^{th}$ week, $v_3$
            \item The goal difference (goals scored - goals conceded) of a team in $n^{th}$ week, $v_4$
            \item The number of points scored by a team in $n^{th}$ week, $v_5$
          \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

% 
% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Linear Transformation and Gradient Ascend}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The linear transformation will transform the 5-dimensional vector into a one-dimensional vector which is the total number of points in the final week $F(v)$
    \item To calculate we will use the following formula: $$ F(v)=wv+b $$
    \item $w$ is a 5-dimensional vector, weights of each variable in vector v
    \item $b$ is the scalar bias - systematic error

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% 
% 
% 
% 
% 
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Using Gradient Ascend}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To calculate w and b, we will use gradient ascend on historical data.
    \item Normalize $v$ and $F(v)$ by centering and standardizing it.
    \item Use normalized data and take out predicted points using any initial value of weight.
    \item See the error by finding the difference between normalized $F(v)$ and predicted $F(v)$
    \item Find the gradient of the weight using the formula - transposed-v.error
    \item Find the gradient of scalar bias using the formula - sum of all elements in error vector
    \item Then to find the updated gradient the following formula is:
    $$ w = w + a*w_{gradient}, \ b = b + a*b_{gradient} $$
    \item Then denormalize w and b to find the actual values

\section{Future Work}
\subsection{Our plans, our limitations and how these models could improve}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Future plans}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Once our models are all complete, we will compare them with respect to efficiency and accuracy in predicting the winning team with this year's data as input. We could make use of Mallows' Cp and BIC statistic to establish which model has the best predictive performance.
    \item We will then critically analyse the most successful model and input a test dataset from earlier years to ensure we have not overfitted to our training dataset.
    \item To improve this model, it would be wise to consider variables other than the teams' performance and establish whether they are confounding and extraneous; for example, the about of money invested in each team.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is this model useful for}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Once the most significant variables have been established, a researcher could potentially use the model to advise  a team's manager of where best to focus their efforts, or indeed they could consult with a bookie to help them predict the odds of the game.
    \item Of course, this model overlooks the human element of the game. Factors that a manager might be aware of such as player motivation, injuries, and team dynamics can have a significant impact on the outcome of a game, but they are challenging to factor into our model.
    \item Ultimately though, it is impossible to control for every variable and, even if we did the result could surprise us. But this model is beneficial in finding which variables give the teams the best chance of success.
