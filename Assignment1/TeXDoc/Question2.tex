\subsection{Comment on which vitamin delivery approach is more effective:}
\paragraph{To determine which vitamin delivery approach is more effective in promoting tooth growth, you should analyze the box-and-whisker plot created in the previous step. Look at the distribution of tooth lengths for guinea pigs given vitamins via ascorbic acid and orange juice.
If the median tooth length for one group is higher than the other, it suggests that the corresponding supplement may be more effective.
Additionally, look for differences in the spread (interquartile range) and the presence of outliers. A supplement with a larger median, smaller spread, and fewer outliers may be considered more effective.}
