\section{Question 3}
\subsection{Expected number of party poppers}
$$ E(X)=Probability\ of\ failure * Total\ number\ of\ party\ poppers $$
$$ E(X)=0.6\% *200=1.2 $$

\subsection{Distribution of fail poppers}
\subsubsection{Poisson Distribution and Binomial Distribution}
\paragraph{I don't know if the condition provided in the first question (200 in a box) holds true in the second question, so I think both the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution can describe the probability of this problem.}
% 
\paragraph{\textbf{Poisson Distribution: }$X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$,
    $\lambda=0.6\%*n$}
\paragraph{\textbf{Binomial Distribution: }$X \sim B(n,p)$, $p=0.006$}
% 
% 
\subsubsection{The assumptions that need to hold for justifying the use of the Poisson and Binomial distribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Events (party poppers failing to go off) occur randomly (only for Poison).
    \item Events are rare, meaning the probability of more than one event occurring in a very short time period is negligible (only for Poison).
    \item Events are independent of each other.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distribution of mistake box}
\subsubsection{Distribution for Y}
\paragraph{For the random variable Y, representing the number of party poppers that fail to go off in a box of 2 (due to the administrative error), we can still use the Poisson or Binomial distribution with the same $\lambda \text{ (Poison)}=n*p \text{ (Binomial)}=0.012$ value as calculated in Question 3.1, which is based on the company's claim.}

\subsubsection{$E(Y)$ and $Var(Y)$}
\paragraph{According to Poisson Distribution, PMF is:}
$$ P(Y=k)=\frac{e^{- \lambda} \lambda^k}{k!} $$
$$ E(Y)= \mu = \lambda =0.012 $$
$$ Var(Y) = \sigma^2 = \lambda=0.012 $$
\paragraph{According to Binomial Distribution, PMF is:}
$$ P(Y=k)= \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$$
$$ E(Y)= n*p =0.012 $$
$$ Var(Y) =n*p*(1-p)=0.01193 $$
